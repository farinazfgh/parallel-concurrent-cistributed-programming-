sum = sum1+sum2 ;
sum 1 lower half
sum 2 upper half
we need both sum1 and sum2 to be able to do sum
# FINISH
    ASYNCH
        sum1= sum of lower half
        sum2= sum of upper half
# END FINISH
sum = sum1+sum2
this way we make sure by the time we do sum, sum1 and sum2 are ready
and we can do sum1 in one core and sum2 by another
